# Chat in PHP

Chat in PHP is an application that allows users to sign up, login and chat with other users.

## Why?

I wanted to try to replicate a chat application and it was a wonderful way to implement what I knew about PHP, MySQL and JavaScript.

## Features

-Users can sign up using their Email ID.
-Users can add or edit their profile anytime.
-Users can login and view list of all other users.
-Users can chat with other users real time.
